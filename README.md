Just started learning react, my first small project Pokedex, nothing special.

## npm install 

To install all of the dependancies

### `npm start` to start the localhost server

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
